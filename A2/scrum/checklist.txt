1) Completed USERSTORIES are in sprintBacklog[1-4].txt and reflect all team members work.

2) Completed BUGS are in sprintBacklog[1-4].txt and reflect all team members work.

3) Completed BUGS and USERSTORIES match one of our specified patterns.

4) All of your branches have been committed and pushed to the remote. 

5) Your branches are nemed by USER STORY and BUG (though there is nothing
   you can do about this now).

6) Your class names reflect the design patterns you use. For example, 
   OthelloCommand might be a good name for the superclass of all
   OthelloCommands. 

7) Fill out architecture.txt. A good approach might be to do what we did
   in https://axiom.utm.utoronto.ca/~207/19f/labs/10/index.shtml
   that is, say which design patterns you used and which classes
   in the project correspond to which in the design pattern

8) Place a notes.txt file in scrum indicating any issues you want
   us to be aware of. For example, if the name/email on the committs
   does not match your name/email etc.

9) Identify the commit id you want us to mark by having a team member
   add it to https://cs.utm.utoronto.ca/~ta/207whichCommit 
   otherwise, we will take the last commit id before the due date.
   Make sure this is on the master branch.

10) Make sure your code works in the lab. The best bet for this is to
    have one team member clone the repo and then try to run the project.
    If there is any special setup or issues we should know about, please
    put it in notes.txt.
